This app consists of a trial of seperating a back end build with Rails and a front end build with React, Feel free to try it!


## Api

[Link to Api endpoint created with Rails](https://random-greeting-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/messages)

## Built With

- React
- JSX
- Redux

## Getting Started

**The project comes shipped with linters config for html and css, so ensure you have lighthouse, ESlint, Webhint**
**and Stylelint installed on your local environment**

- **To get a local copy of the repository please run the following commands on your terminal:**
- **$ git clone https://github.com/hello-react-front-end**
- **$ cd ...**
- **$ git checkout ...**
- **$ run npm install to couple all dependencies**


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
